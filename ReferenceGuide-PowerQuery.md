### __[Basics to know]()__

__M__ is the powerful language behind __Power Query__ helping to import, change and restructure big amounts of data. It's hidden behind the graphical interface of __Power Query Editor__ that is designed for "non-programmers". We still recommend to spend some time to understand the M syntax and how M works. There are many powerful operations to perform with M that you are not able of doing through its graphical interface.

This is __compact tutorial__, an __reference guide__ or a __cheat-sheet__ that explains basics of M, its syntax and through some advanced examples gives you deep understanding and solution to some problems that every Power Query developer at some point get stuck with. 

Bookmark this page, share it and feel free to [__reach out to us__](www.cmq.se "Contact us!") with questions, comments or requests for assignments!

_Prerequisites: Some excel & programing skills._


Let's go though core and basic areas of Power Query M language, some commonly used expressions and dig into few solutions that we think are very beneficial to all M developers to understand. We start with basics and move forward with more and more advanced stuff.

Official [Power Query M language specification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/powerquery-m/power-query-m-language-specification) 

<p align=right><a id="why-m-in-m" align=right href="#table-of-content">↩ Back To Top</a></p>

#### [Why M?]()
---

M is the language behind the scene of Power Query that in turn is build in Excel and Bower BI. 
M is a script language created by Microsoft for usage in their [Power Query tootls]([#what-is-power-query?](https://www.howtoexcel.org/power-query/power-query-tips-and-tricks/)) designed to build queries that "mash-up" data. "M" stands here for "mash-up". M is very similar to [_F#_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)) used for financial and scientific applications in particular. M provides a powerful data import experience that encompasses many features. You might wonder what data "mashup" is? This is a term used to describe the action of combining and modifying collected data to create a personalized data sets. The core capability of Power Query is to mashup data using M scripting language.

With Power Query is is very easy to import and transform data in ways Excel finds difficult. There are importing functionality and connections to external sources that can automate lots of repetitive workflows! You can do a lot in Power Query in its Editor by selecting and clicking in the UI, without writing any single line of code, but at some point you might need to dig and modify the auto-generated M code or write your own M functions. Therefore we recommend to understand at least the basics of the syntax of M. 


<p align=right><a id="power-query-editor-in-m" align=right href="#table-of-content">↩ Back To Top</a></p>

#### [Power Query Editor]()
---

Power Query Editor is a graphical script editor and part of [Excel](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/getting-started-with-power-query-7104fbee-9e62-4cb9-a02e-5bfb1a6c536a "Getting Started with Power Query in Excel") and [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/getting-started-with-power-query-part-i/ "Getting Started with Power Query in Power BI"). It's used for working with M through its graphical interface that present M code as clickable list of steps. It is designed to be used by persons without any coding experience, hiding the M code building up the query from users. But in Power Query editor you can open Advanced Editor ` View -> Advanced Editor` where M code can be written or modified on your own. Advanced Editor is a simple but fully functional textual editor for M code.

 In Excel the Power Query Editor can be launched in several ways:<br> 
 - Launch it manually from `Data tab → Get Data → Launch Power query Editor...`
 - Launch by importing any data to from  `Data tab → Get & Transform Data` section.
 - Launch by clicking on existing query in List-Of-Queries found in `Data tab → Queries & Connections` 


<p align=right><a id="basics-of-m" align=right href="#table-of-content">↩ Back To Top</a></p>

#### [Basics of M]()
---
When you open any Power Query editor the first thing you will see is an `let` `in` expression and probably lots of text lines beginning with short words like `#"Source"` or `#"changed Types"`. In the area _between_ `let` and `in`, on each line we declare one variable followed by `=` and an expression that perform some action or actions. Each of this lines (that end with an `,` character) in M is called __a step__. Final result returned by query is defined in the end _after_ `in` expression. A _let/in_ expression is a block that produces a value like table, list, number or text and can be used wherever values are expected. This means we can assign such a block to variables, nest them inside other let/in expressions.

```javascript
// Comment - a simple let/in block
let
  VariableA = "Hello",
  #"Variable B" = "World",
  SimpleText = VariableA & " " & #"Variable B",
  Result = Text.Combine({SimpleText, "!"})
in
  Result  
  

 → Hello World!
```

```javascript
// Nested let/in block assigned to variable
let	
	NestedBlock = let			
					A = 10,
					B = 20
				 in
					A * B,

	Result = NestedBlock
in
	Result


→ 200
```
_ Each step is a variable declaration that execute some code and must be ended by `,`. A step can be on own its line but does not have to. Variable names can be without spaces or consist of short sentences with spaces in between words but must then be within ` #""` brackets. _

Users of Power Query that don't have any M knowledge usually click on buttons that auto-create steps through the graphical interface of Power Query Editor. The step are then created and named automatically. This is not very practical if you write M code by yourself. In most programing languages, variable names are shorter one worded expressions that are easy to identify and relate to by looking at the code. But since Power Query is designed for people without any M skills, that will not modify M code on their own therefore the auto-generated names are are descriptive sentences instead of short one-worded names. In example in this documents we edit and add code though Advanced Editor and we use Short one worded step names in order to make the code be more readable and tidy.

When looking at a query you might think that steps are evaluated in sequential order as they appear in the query. This is NOT the case though. Power Query evaluates steps only when needed for final result   and in any order is chooses to be most efficient. This is called programing world for _lazy evaluation_.  If output from a step is not needed to produce the final result value that is returned by `in` then such a step may not be evaluated at all.

```javascript
let	
	A = 10,
	B = "I'm here",  // This step is never used
	C = 20,
	Result = A*C
in
	Result


→ 200
```

Power query is designed to handle and modify big amount of tabular repetitive data. Due to that main objects that we mostly work with in Power Query are Tables, List and Records. Of course variable of type like integer, text do exist and are used in the scrip flow. But main native functions as well as the results of steps or the query itself most often is of type Table or List. Therefore understanding what table and list is in Power Query is essential first thing to do when learning M.

The gasoline for Power Query "engine" is data - therefore importing of data functionality is a big part of Power Query. Thats why each query normally starts with step named "Source" that first-of-all imports the data into the query.

#### [Import data into a query]()
---

Power Query comes with a build-in intuitive functionality to automatically connect and import data from various sources. You can import data from a table in same document you are in, other excel documents, files like PDF or CSV on your hard-drive or connect to web addresses or external databases. More about this can be read [here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/define-and-use-names-in-formulas-4d0f13ac-53b7-422e-afd2-abd7ff379c64). Microsoft is constantly adding and improving connections to various sources that users might need data from. In Excel data importing options can be found in `Data -> Get & Transform data` section. In Power BI in [TODO](TODO).

__Example of a basic data import to a query from Excel table/range in current workbook.__<br> In your opened excel workbook click on a cell or select section containing data that you would like to import into a query - `Get Data -> Get & Transform data -> From Table/Range`. At current moment (2020) Excel need the data to be imported from a _[table](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/overview-of-excel-tables-7ab0bb7d-3a9e-4b56-a3c9-6c94334e492c)_ and if the cell/range you have selected is not recognized by Excel as a table then it will launch wizard to navigate you through converting you selected range to a table Is described more deeply [here](TODO). Afterward Power Query Editor launches and auto-generates a new query that imports your selected data. In this new query data is loaded in first variable (called step) usually named `Source`. Second step that Power Query used to add in most import cases is "_auto detection of column types_". This step is usually named `Changed Type`. Sometimes its intelligent guess of what are the types of elements in the columns types is might not be fully correct and needs your attention to change column-by-column manually. Also this step cam be safely removed. You can now in the opened Power Query Advanced Editor further work on and modify data in this query according to your needs. When done click `Close & Load` button and load the query into your workbook. Power query will ask where to place the data. It always places the data in Excel worksheets as a table in a predefined default template style. 

Read more details on how to import from other sources in this good tutorial [here](TODO).

_<a id="examples-of-data-import-in-m">Examples:</a> Some M functions that import data._

__From current worksheet.__ _Tables_ and _Named Ranges_ from your current workbook.
```javascript
// Import all objects in current Excel workbook to Power Query as a table. Tables, Sheets and Named Ranges defined in workbook will each one reside one row in this table.
TableWithObjects = Excel.CurrentWorkbook()


```

__From local folder.__: List of _Files_ with _Attributes_ in a specific local location.
```javascript
// Import all files from a specific folder and sub-folders.
TableWithFiles = Folder.Files("C:\Users\marti\Favorites")


```

__From Web-page__: HTML presented as _Tables_
```javascript
// Import HTML web page represented as tables
TableWithWabPage = Web.Page(Web.Contents("https://www.timeanddate.com/"))


```

#### [Types in M]()
---
Every step, variable, field or column in Power Query script must have a specific Data Type associated to it. For example in excel "1" set as text or 1 set as number show differently (on different side in column) in GUI. Below we list some most common types used in Power Query.

More detailed description about types can be found in the blog [here](https://www.poweredsolutions.co/2018/03/12/data-types-data-conversion-ascribed-data-types-power-query-power-bi/). 


||||
---|---|---
Type number | 1 or 1,2
Type text | "a", "1" or "two words"
Type logical | true or false
Tape table | #table({},{})  → _empty table_
Type list | {1,2}
Type record | [A=1, B=2]
Type function | ???
datetime | ??
Type date | ??
Type time | ??
Type duration | ??
Type binary | usually a file
Type nullable | ???

##### What do `nullable` mean in Power Query M?
So what does it mean that a type is nullable and how does it affect us? If you do ever compare `null` value with any other value by a relational operator (<, >, <=, >=) then the result of comparison is not the logical value as you might expect but the null itself. Also then Value compared in if-statement is `null` then error is thrown:<br> `if null < 5 then "A" else "B"` → error.

Therefor you can cast a type that usually is not null to a type that can contain null. Type number is not nullable by default therefore `if null < 5` fails. If 5 here was defined as `type nullable number` then it would not fail.

When a column is of type nullable number or a input parameter to a function is type nullable number then we implicitly tell that this number can be null and telling Power Query not throwing error it it happens.

__TODO investigate/understand/test this more and describe better..__


<br><p align=right><a id="functions-in-m" align=right href="#table-of-content">↩ Back To Top</a></p>


#### [Functions in M]()
---

In Power Query function is a mapping from a set of input values to a single output value. Functions are defined by `(param) => "body returning value"`, function body follows the goes-to (=>). A function can later be assigned to a variable, i.e. X = FunctionA - then you can execute it by calling X(e) instead of functionA(e). Functions be used as a parameters to another functions. We need to distinguish between invoking a function and referring to it. When assigned to a parameter or passed as parameter to other function we do not write out () nor the parameters - just the function name. The type of input parameter(s) and the type of value that the function returns can be defined but is optional. `() => 1+2` is a valid simple _unnamed_ function returning value 3.

__Example:__ <a id="functions-e">Functions</a><br>
Function that is named fnCalculate
```javascript
// Function fnCalculate
(B as number) as number => 
let
	A = 10,
	Result = A * B
in 	
	Result
```	
Another query referring to and invoke fnCalculate
```javascript
let
	B = 20,

	// Renaming existing function (referring to it,)
	newFunctionName = fnCalculate,

	// Invoke the same function
	Result1 = fnCalculate(B),
	Result2 = newFunctionName(B),

	// Prof that same function can have 2 names
	Result = if (Result1 = Result2) then "SAME" else "DIFFER"

in
	Result
```	
 `SAME` is returned because 200=200


<br><p align=right><a id="each-in-m" align=right href="#table-of-content">↩ Back To Top</a></p>

#### [`Each`]() & [`_`]()
---

Expression __`each`__ is a _function definition_ with one input variable without name nor type. It is simple _the abbreviation_ for __`(_) =>`__. It has not the same functionality nor meaning as "each" in java or C#. In M "conditional functions" are functions returning type logical (true or false). Those functions very often passed as input parameters to other functions in order to be called repetitively over sets of data (list elements, table rows or record elements ). Then word "each" makes sense in this context when defining those "conditional functions".

Expression __`__`__ is an _unnamed variable_ in a function. The use of `_`  (that is called a throw-away_ variable) is common across several programming languages, Python included. Whenever a name of the input variable to a function is not necessary to be known (declared), in order to have less to write `_` can be used. Sometimes in obvious cases where the variable name is absolutely necessary, writing out `_` can be skipped if used with `each`.  

For example:<br> `tSelectedRows = Table.SelectRows(Source, each [Age] < 25)`<br><br>[Table.SelectRows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/table-selectrows)(table, "conditional function") calls the "conditional function" for each and every row in the table Source. The "conditional function" receives a row as a record with each call and if it returns true then whole row is added result, otherwise row removed. The whole `each` `_` concept is best described by following examples:

__Example:__ <a id="each-e">Explaining each</a> 
```javascript
let
	list = {1, 2, 3, 4},
	
	// Identical functions
	function1 = (elem) => elem * 100,
	function2 = each _ * 100,

	// Function Transform() calls functionX for every list elem
	result1 = List.Transform(list, function1),
	result2 = List.Transform(list, function2),

	// Prof that each is (_) => 
	result = if (result1 = result2) then "SAME" else "DIFFER"
in
	result

Returns  →   SAME

// Similar as above but as a one-liner
let
	result = List.Transform({1, 2, 3, 4}, each _ * 100)
in
	result

Returns  →  {100, 200, 300, 400}
```
<br>

```javascript
let
    table = #table( {"Age","Name"}, {{18,"Anna"},{68,"Ewa"}} ),

	// Exactly same functions
	function1 = (row as record) as logical => row[Age] < 23,
	function2 = each _[Age] < 23,
    function3 = each [Age] < 23,

	// Function SelectRows() calls functionX for every row
    Result1 = Table.SelectRows(table, function1),
    Result2 = Table.SelectRows(table, function2),
	Result3 = Table.SelectRows(table, function3),


	// Prof that "each _[Age]" is same as "each [Age]"
    Result = if (Result1 = Result2) and (Result1 = Result3) then "SAME" else "DIIFER"
in
    Result

Returns  →   SAME

// Similar as above but as a one-liner

result = Table.SelectRows(#table({"Age","Name"},{{18,"Anna"},{68,"Ewa"}}), each [Age] < 23)

Returns →  #table({"Age", "Name"}, {{18,"Anna"}} )  (Ewa, over 23 was row removed)

#### [Handle errors]()

#### [Lists]()
---

A _list_ can be described as _an ordered sequence of values of any type_. It is easy to visualize, work with and iterate over a list. Each element of a list is assigned an index starting with 0, meaning first element in a list always has value 0. M supports infinitely large lists. 

 Records can be empty - defined like this `{}`. Operators `=` and `<>` make it possible to compare lists, while `&` combines lists. List are easy and fast to iterate (loop) over.

_<a id="list-example-in-m">Example:</a> List example_
```
Define   →  L = {"a", 24} 
Get value   →  L{0}  →  a
Get value   →  L{List.Count(L)-1}  → 24
# elements  →  List.Count(L)  →  2
```
It happens that a list is empty. This may cause error and abort execution of the query. Do not forget guard for it.

```
Define  →  L = {} 
Get value → L{List.Count(L)-1} → error: index can't be negative
Get value → try {}{List.Count(L)-1} otherwise null →  null
```
You can read more about records [here](https://ssbi-blog.de/blog/technical-topics-english/lists-in-power-query-how-when-and-why/).



<a id="list-syntax-example-in-m">Example:</a> Following examples demonstrates syntax 


```javascript
//
// Returnes a string consisting of combined elemnts in
// lists. List elements are transformed.
// In end counts words in the output.
//

let
	List1 = {"adam", "&", "ewa"},
  	List2 = {"are", 24, "years", "old"},   // Note number in List2
	
  	// Capitalize list elements - by invoking function Proper() for each item.
  	List1_uppercase = List.Transform(List1, Text.Proper),
  	
	// Combine list-of-lists, to one list.
  	#"List1 & List2 combined" = List.Combine({List1_uppercase, List2}),
  	
	// Convert elements to text - by invoking function From() for each list elem.
  	#"Elems to texts" =  List.Transform(#"List1 & List2 combined", Text.From),
  	
	// Combine list elements, to one string, words separated by space.
  	#"Lists as string" = Text.Combine(#"Elems to texts", " "),
	
	// Add string to the end of a string  
  	#"Final string" = Text.Insert(#"Lists as string", Text.Length(#"Lists as string"), "!"),
  	
	// Count words in string
	NbrOfWords = List.Count(Text.Split(#"Final string", " ")),
	  
	Output = #"Final string" & " (number of words = " & Number.ToText(NbrOfWords) & ")"
in
  	Output
```
 String `"Adam & Ewa are 24 years old!"` is returned.


<br><p align=right><a id="records-in-m" align=right href="#table-of-content">↩ Back To Top</a></p>

#### [Records]()
---

A _record_ can be described as a set of _name=value_ pairs where _name_ is a text reference unique within the record and _value_ is an element of any type. 

 Records can be empty - defined like this `[]`. Operators `=` and `<>` make it possible to compare records, while `&` combines records. It's rare for a record to be loaded into the data model in Excel or Power BI, but if done it behaves like a table with _names_ as table headers and _values_ in first row. Note, a row of a table is Power Query presented as a record. 

You can read more about records [here](https://ssbi-blog.de/blog/technical-topics-english/records-in-power-query-how-when-and-why/).

_<a id="record-example-in-m">Example:</a> Record example_
```
Define  →  Record = [A=1, B=2] 
Get value  →  Record[B]  →  2
Table.FromRecords({Record, Record}) →
+-------+
| A | B |
|---+---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 2 |
+---+---+
```

<br><p align=right><a id="tables-in-m" align=right href="#table-of-content">↩ Back To Top</a></p>

#### [Tables]()
---
A _table_ can be described as a set of _rows and columns_ building up _cells_ where the values are stored. The very top of each table contains __unique__ _column names_ (aka headers names) that must always exist. Column names are case sensitive, "Name" is not same as "name". If _header names_ are not defined or of some reason unknown (normal scenario when importing data from i.e. csv files) then M auto-creates default names like "Column1", "Column2" etc. In Power Query tables are important as Power Query mostly works with sets of data represented as tables. Tables are also often returned by functions, steps or queries and auto-created when data is imported to Power Query.

It's important to understand that in Power Query M rows of a table are represented as_ records of values_, while columns are represented as _list of values_. Hold this in mind is when using [native M functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/power-query-m-function-reference) as often parameters and iterations of those functions over rows or column are _lists_ or _records_.

_<a id="record-example-in-m">Example:</a> Example showing how to refer to elements ina table "T"_
```
Define → T = #table({"A"=number,"B"=number},{{1,2},{2,4}}) 
Define → T = Table.FromRows({{1,2},{2,4}},{"A","B"})

 T[A] = {1,2}
  ↓
+-------+
| A | B | ← Header → {A, B}
|---+---|
| 1 | 2 | ← T[B]{0} = 2
| 1 | 2 | ← T{1} = [A=1,B=2]
+---+---+
```

The header of a column also defines the data type of elements in the column i.e. `number`, `text`, `logical` (go to [types section](#types-example-in-m)) or `any` - which means that such a column can contain elements with a mix of types.

There are mainly 3 operators that can be used in conjunction with tables: `=`, `<>` and `&`. first two are preytty straight forward. The third one `&` is worth some extra explanation.

_<a id="record-example-in-m">Example:</a> Using `=` and `<>` on tables_
```javascript
// Order of column do not matter!
tbl = #table({"A","B"},{{1,2}}) = #table({"A","B"},{{1,2}}) → true
tbl = #table({"A","B"},{{1,2}}) = #table({"B","A"},{{2,1}}) → true

tbl = #table({"A","B"},{{1,2}}) = #table({"A","B","C"},{{1,2,3}}) → false
tbl = #table({"A","B"},{{1,2}}) <> #table({"a","B"},{{1,2}}) → true
```

_<a id="record-example-in-m">Example:</a> Combining tables by using `&`_
```javascript
tblA		tblB
+-------+	+-------+
| A | B |	| A | B |
|---+---|	|---+---|
| 1 |   |	| 1 | 2 | 
+---+---+	+---+---+ 

// Combine
T = tblA & tblB 
T= = Table.Combine({tblA, tblB}) (same but with function)

T
+-------+
| A | B |
|---+---+
| 1 |   |
| 1 | 2 |
+---+---+
```

```javascript
tblA		tblB
+-------+	+-------+
| A | B |	| b | c |
|---+---|	|---+---|
| 1 |   |	| 1 | 2 | 
+---+---+	+---+---+ 

// Combine
T = tblA & tblB 
T= = Table.Combine({tblA, tblB}) (same but with function)

T
+-------+-------+
| A | B | b | c |
|---+---|---+---|
| 1 |   | 1 | 2 | 
+---+---+---+---+ 
```

As it can be seen in example above when both columns names are same 2 rows are produced. In second case when they differ in case - only one. This is because "B" and "b" are not same names in the eyes of Power Query. <br> Therefore:<br> When _combining_ tho tables with exact same amount of column with exactly same names, then the number of rows will be doubled in the result. Rows are _"added"_ on top of each other. While when combining tables with sae amount of columns but all different names will produce table with same amount total rows - but double amount of columns. They are _"added"_ next to each other.

 Some useful function to keep in mind:
 - [Table.FromRecords(list of records i.e. _{[A=1,B=2],[B=1,B=2]}_)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/Table-FromRecords)<br> Creates a new table from the list of records and __returns__ this new __table__. 
 - [Table.ColumnNames(table)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/table-columnnames)<br> Puts names of each column in a list and __returns__ this new __list__.
 - [Table.TransformRows(table, _callback-function(current row as record)_)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/table-transformrows)<br> This complex and very useful function can return a table or list depending on what calls, for each row in the table, the callback-function with current row (in form of record) as input. Whatever value, record or single value) the callback-function returns is used as source for a new row. When done with all iterations puts those new "transformed" rows in a new table and __returns__ this new __table__.
 - [Table.TransformColumns(tbl, list, )](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/table-transformcolumns)<br>
 - [Table.TransformColumnTypes(table, list with <name>,<type> elements. I.e. {"colA,typeA , colB,typeB"})](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/table-transformcolumntypes)<br> This function 
 creates new columns the type of one or several columns of the table that provided as first parameter. The result is returned as a NEW modified table. The second parameter is a list of elements with syntax `{"ColName", type X}` - describing what column(s) and what type to change to. Unfortunately most often this column names are __hard-coded__, making the function very sensitive to any future changes in column names. A simple change like "Name"  → "name" in the input data will make this function and whole query fail. There are cases when we can avoid hard-coding column names and this is presented in one of the examples below.

#### [Accessing values]()

Here comes some syntax on how to access parts of lists, records of tables

__TABLES__
```java
T
+-------+
| A | B |
|---+---+
| 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 4 |
+---+---+

T[A] →  a list {1, 3}
T{1} → a record [A=3, B=4]
T[B]{2}→ T{[A=2]}[B] → Table.Column(T, "B"){2} →  a single value 4

//The way T{[A=2]} only possible if values in column A are unique. Otherwise TODO???


Table.ColumnNames(T) → a list of texts {"A", "B"}
Table.ColumnNames(T){1} → a single text "B"

T[X] → error
T[X]? → null
T[A]? →  a list {1, 3}
Table.ColumnNames(T){2} → error
Table.ColumnNames(T){2}? → null ???

Note, when `?` is used after field reference then null is returned in case of "not found". Otherwise error is thrown!

var = "A"
T[var] → error  // referring to column from [] do not support variables
Table.Column(T, var) →  a list {1, 3} // here its fine to use variable

Withing brackets [] variables are not allowed. Here native functions can be used.
```

__RECORDS__
```java
R = [A=1, B=2, C=3]

R[A] → Record.Field(R, "A") → a single value 1
Record.FieldNames(R)  → a list of texts {"A", "B", "C"}
Record.FieldNames(R){0}  → a text "A"

R[X] → error
R[X]? → null 
R[A]? → a single value 1
Record.Field(R, "X")  →  ??? error or null 

var="A"
R[var] → error // referring to column from [] do not support variables
Record.Field(R, var) → a single value 1 // here its fine to use variable
```

__LISTS__
```
L = {1, 2, 3, 4}

L{0} → 1
L{1} → error
L{1}? → null

#### [Reshape a table]()
---

Following short examples describe how you reshape a table to different order of columns, different amount of columns with different values, modify ranges of values or how in Power Query just to  modified one single value in a table. Function `Table.TransformRows(table, function)` is very useful. Why? check the code bellow.

_<a id="reshape-example-1-table.transformRows-in-m">Example 1</a>: "Reshaping" to table to exactly same shape_
```
Table T
+-----------------------------+
| ID | First name | Last name |
|-----------------------------+
| 1  |   adam     |  lee      |
+----+------------+-----------+
| 2  |   ewa      |  cox      |
+-----------------------------+
```

```javascript
let
    T = #table({"ID","First name","Last name"},{{1,"adam","lai"},{2,"ewa","lee"}}),
    Result = Table.FromRecords(Table.TransformRows(T,each _))
in
    Result
```
Here the transform function `each _` (second input parameter in in function [Table.TransformRows()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/table-transformrows)) receives, for every row, current row as a record. Due to _ the very same input records is returned from the function (see section [functions](TODO)). As a result this function __returns a list of records__ as seen bellow.

```
Table.TransformRows() result
+--------+
|  List  |
|--------+
| record |
+--------+
| record |
+--------+
```
This list of records is in turn the input parameter to outer function [Table.FromRecords()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/table-fromrecords) as this function takes exactly this as input - a list of records. The inner function returns a list of records -> the outer function consumes a list of records. Perfect. In this example exactly same table as the one we stared with is produced.

<br>

_<a id="reshape-example-2-table.transformRows-in-m">Example 2</a>: "Reshaping" the table by combining two columns, capitalizing texts and reordering columns._
```
Table T
+-----------------------------+
| ID | First name | Last name |
|-----------------------------+
| 1  |   adam     |  lee      |
+----+------------+-----------+
| 2  |   ewa      |  cox      |
+-----------------------------+
```
```javascript
let
    T = #table({"ID","First name","Last name"},{{1,"adam","lai"},{2,"ewa","lee"}}),
    fknTransform = each [Name=Text.Proper([First name]) & " " & [Last name], id=[ID]],
    Result = Table.FromRecords(Table.TransformRows(T, fknTransform))
in
    Result
```

```
+---------------+
|   Name   | id |
|---------------+
| Adam lee | 1  |
+----------+----+
| Ewa cox  | 2  |
+---------------+
```
Exactly same technique as in example 1 above with the modification of transform function, second input parameter in in function [Table.TransformRows()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/table-transformrows) moved to own row for better readability. This function takes in current row record with three items [Id=.., First name=.., Last name=..] and returns a record with two items [Name=.., id=..]. In one go we changed order of columns, combined columns, capitalized elements, changes header names, and this function very well could have been written as a readable one-liner. Powerful.

<br>

_<a id="reshape-example-2-table.transformRows-in-m">Example 3</a>: Change only one single value of a column in Power Query._
```
Table T
+-----------------------------+
| ID | First name | Last name |

| 1  |   adam     |  lee      |  ← i.e- change lee to null
+----+------------+-----------+
| 2  |   ewa      |  lee      |
+-----------------------------+
```
Before starting!<br>
In order to identify one unique cell in a table at least one column with all unique values must exist. In database-world a filed (=column) with all unique values can be set to a [primary key](TODO). Before trying to change a values in a table cell we must know what column contains only unique values. In our example we call such a column a "primary key column".

We assume here that table T in this example has column ID as "primary-key-colum" and every  value in ID column is and will be _unique_ for every row.

_Useful info! When you use the "Remove Duplicates" button in Power Query Editor to remove all duplicate values from a column or columns, which behind the scenes uses the [Table.Distinct()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/table-distinct) M function, then Power Query behind the scene defines a primary key on a table._

The code used function Table.AddColumn() that work in similar way as Table.TransformRows() as it iterates over each row and provides current row to a callback table. It could be implemented with Table.TransformRows() but as in sfinal part of this example we will transform this to fully dynamic function, then Table.TransformRows() would put a limitation as we need need to know all the field names. TODO is it really tru, can it not be dome with transform?
```javascript
let
    T = #table({"ID","First name","Last name"},{{1,"adam","lai"},{2,"ewa","lee"}}),

    // Values to provide each time in order 
    // to change one value in table Table.
    // Dynamic values. Can be changed for each run!
    NewValue = "CHANGED", 
    Table = T, // Table to change
    PrimKeyColumnName = "ID", // Name of primary key column, with all-unique-values
    PrimKeyValueToChange = 2, // Row to change
    ColumnNameToChange = "Last name", // Column to change

    // Small trick for later. 
    // Rename the column that is defined by PrimKeyColumnName as primary key
    // to a name defined by us, static name, never changing.
    TableBeforeChange = Table.RenameColumns(Table, {PrimKeyColumnName, "PK"}),

    // Save originals for later use, all as lists.
    lOriginalColumns = Table.ColumnNames(TableBeforeChange),
    lOriginalValues = Table.Column(TableBeforeChange, ColumnNameToChange),
    lPrivateKeys = TableBeforeChange[PK],

    // AddColumn() calls each-function for every row,then for desired row we set the new value otherwise old
    // Because field references like [mColName] are never dynamic
    TableAfterChange = Table.AddColumn(
		TableBeforeChange, 
		"TempCol", 
		each if ([PK]=PrimKeyValueToChange) then NewValue else lOriginalValues{List.PositionOf(lPrivateKeys,[PK])}),
    
    // Remove org name, rename tem name to org, restore previous order
    T1 = Table.RemoveColumns(TableAfterChange, ColumnNameToChange),
    T2 = Table.RenameColumns(T1, {"TempCol", ColumnNameToChange}),
    T3 = Table.ReorderColumns(T2, lOriginalColumns),

    Result=T3 
in
    Result
```

Same as above moved out to a fully dynamic function. Save the following function with name `fnChangeValue`.
```javascript
(Table as table, NewValue as any, PrimKeyColumnName as text, PrimKeyValueToChange as any, ColumnNameToChange ) as table =>
let
    // Small trick for later. 
    // Rename the column that is defined by PrimKeyColumnName as primary key
    // to a name defined by us, static name, never changing.
    TableBeforeChange = Table.RenameColumns(Table, {PrimKeyColumnName, "PK"}),

    // Save originals for later use, all as lists.
    lOriginalColumns = Table.ColumnNames(TableBeforeChange),
    lOriginalValues = Table.Column(TableBeforeChange, ColumnNameToChange),
    lPrivateKeys = TableBeforeChange[PK],

    // AddColumn() calls each-function for every row,then for desired row we set the new value otherwise old
    // Because field references like [mColName] are never dynamic
    TableAfterChange = Table.AddColumn(
		TableBeforeChange, 
		"TempCol", 
		each if ([PK]=PrimKeyValueToChange) then NewValue else lOriginalValues{List.PositionOf(lPrivateKeys,[PK])}),
    
    // Remove org name, rename tem name to org, restore previous order
    T1 = Table.RemoveColumns(TableAfterChange, ColumnNameToChange),
    T2 = Table.RenameColumns(T1, {"TempCol", ColumnNameToChange}),
    Result = Table.ReorderColumns(T2, lOriginalColumns)
in  
    Result
```
Calling our function from any query
```javascript
let
    T = #table({"ID","First name","Last name"},{{1,"adam","lai"},{2,"ewa","lee"}}),

	// change the value
    Result = fnChangeValue(T, null, "ID", 1, "Last name")
in
    Result
```
Changing a value in a table, totally dynamically is not a straight forward query to write. Here is a solution that works. There can be some error handling added and a performance tweak. Full solution can be found in our blog TODO [here](TODO).


<p align=right><a id="looping-and-iterations-in-m" align=right href="#table-of-content">↩ Back To Top</a></p>


#### [Looping & Iterations]()
---
Looping and iterations in M work a bit differently. Here we do not have while for for- statements. In M we always loop over a range, and a callback function is usually called for each iteration. This is the standard procedure for most natime List, Record and Table functions.

[List.Accumulate()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/list-accumulate "Documentation for the function") and its 2nd parameter "seed" is of type "any", meaning that this function is not limited to lists objects, but can handle and  return any structured value like: tables, lists or records. En our example we just add a simple number as list element in callback but this technique can be used to perform more complicated iterative tasks on table or records. Function List.Accumulate is very powerful as iterations on sets of lists is big part of Power Query.

 __Example:__ Iterations in M 
_Just for comparison, in C#, it may looks like this_
```javascript
static List<int> GetList()
{
	// Initial variables
	int NbrOfIterations = 5;
	List<int> Result = new List<int>();

	// Function to call for each iteration, adds item to a list
	void AddToList(List<int> res, int i) { res.Add(i); }

	// Iterate using for loop
	for (int i = 1; i <= NbrOfIterations; i++)
	{
		AddToList(Result, i);
	}

	Console.WriteLine(string.Join("\t", Result));
	return Result;  
}

List `1 2 3 4 5` is returned
```
_Iterate in M over another list using List.Accumulate._
```javascript
// Similar thing in M language, iterating over another list
let
	// Initial variables
	Iterations = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},

	// Function to call for each iteration, adds item to a list
	AddToList = (res, i) => List.Combine({res, {i}}),

	// Iterate using function Accumulate(list, seed, accumulator(state, current))
	Result = List.Accumulate(Iterations, {}, AddToList)
in 
	Result

	List `1 2 3 4 5` is returned
```

 I think the example above might need some explanation. List.Accumulate is a function that loops through items of a list and calls a provided function for each iteration. Following description of parameters explain how it works. It is a very powerful function - worth understanding! 

 The key here are parameters, specially a bit "special behavior" of parameters in the callback function ("accumulator"):<br> __List.Accumulate( list , seed , accumulator(state, current) )__ 

__list__ - Here we provide a list "iterations" which is {1,2,3,4,5}. Accumulate() calls the callback function (set in 3rd parameter) for each element in this list. As we have in tot 5 elements in the list, then Accumulate() will iterate 5 times meaning function `AddToList` will be called 5 times.

__seed__ - Start value for the very first iteration, the initial "state". As we expect the rest to be a list then we provide empty `list` as input that we later iterations add values to. In first iteration this exact value (empty list) is sent to our callback as "res" (state) parameter. 

__accumulator__ - Our function that that defines what to do for each iteration. It is often called "callback function" as we send it as parameter into another function that later call it. Accumulate() calls it for each iteration. By [definition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/list-accumulate) it has two required input parameters. First parameter, in documentation, is called "state" and simply is a value return in previous iteration. But for very first iteration there is no previous value. Yes, and here is where the __seed__ value, our start value, comes to use. In our case we provided empty list as initial value so it is provided to callback in first iteration. Second time callback function is called the result from previous run was a list with 1 element, third run it's a list with 2 element, and so on. The second parameter in the callback function, __current__ is simply the current element of the list Accumulate() iterates over. First tie it is element 1, second element 2 an so on.

_Similar thing in M language, using recursiveness_
```javascript
	let 
		// Defining initial variables
		Iterations = 5,

		// Iterate using recursiveness
		Iterate = (i) => if (i > 0) then List.Combine({@Result(i-1), {i}}) else {},

		Result = Iterate(Iterations)
	in
		Result

		List `1 2 3 4 5` is returned
```
In example above we use recursive function. When a function in M calls itself from inside itself then @ parameter must be used when called!

_Finally combining the both M techniques above -auto-create a list to later iterate over with Accumulate() function._
```javascript
	
	// Iterate only by defining number of iterations (here 10000)
	let
		Iterations = (i) => if (i > 0) then List.Combine({@Iterations(i-1), {i}}) else {},

		// Function to call for each iteration, adds item to a list
		AddToList = (res, i) => List.Combine({res, {i}}),

		// Iterate using Accumulate(list, seed, accumulator(state, current)) function
		Result = List.Accumulate(Iterations(10000), {}, AddToList)

	in
		Result

		List `1 2 3 4 5 ... 10000` is returned

```

#### [Change column names dynamically]()

There is often problematic whn code is auto-generated by Power Query that hard-coded column names are used in the query. This might work for the data loaded in at the moment, but same second as little as a letter changes in a column nama in source data, or a new column is added, then our query need to regenerated and debugged.

The main problem are always column and referring to those from code!
