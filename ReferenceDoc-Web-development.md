## [**Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**](#)

---

Visual Studio Code ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) is a popular, lightweight and free code editor.  

Terminal commands:
`code` - starts from command without any project open  
`code .` - start from command with folder that command is run in

<div id="what-is-vscode" />

### **[What's built-in?](#)**

VSCode comes with various  build-in features. some of those are:
-   **JavaScript suppport:** JS runs natively in browsers and NodeJS.
-   **TypeScript support**: TS adds strict typing syntax/rules to JavaScript.
-   **Node.js & Npm**: Runtime environment for JavaScript outside a browser with default access to package manager (npm).
-   **IntelliSense**: Editing aid to code faster in form of suggestions, code completion and quick lookups. 
-   **Emmet**: Predefined short text snippets proposed by intellisense that auto-generate larger pieces of HTML, CSS or other code.
-   **Extensions:** Integrated marketplace for extensions that expand functionality of VSCode.
-   **GIT:** Integrated support for Git with handy graphical interface for most common functions.
-   **Multi-Cursor editing:** Allows you to edit multiple parts of same documents at once.
-   **Debugging, Code navigation**: Possible to debug your code easily.

Commands are executed in special conditional context defined by a `when` statement. 
List of conditional operators -> [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/when-clause-contexts). Available commands can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/commands).
Default VSCode keyboard shortcuts [for windows in general](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf)
Read more about shortcuts at [microsoft.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).

For example if we want to run a special shortcut command any when editor has focus (cursor is blinking) then we define when as "when: editorTextFocus". Or if we want to run it for special command only for a special language i.e. html then we set when to "resourceLangId == html".

<p align="right"><a id="snippets-in-vscode" href="#table-of-content">‚Ü© Back To Top</a></p>

### **[Snippets](#)**

To see a **list of all snippets** for a file extension (given language) open Commad Palette `Snippets: Insert Snippet` to view list of own defined snippets,default VsCode snippets and sippets added extensions. From this list it is easy to **disable** them from being shown in intellisense.

You can **create own snippet**s. They can be global applied in all workspaces, or localy just for current workspace. Create VSCode snippets from Command Palette - `Snippets: Configure User Snippets` and choose `new global snippets...` or `new snipper for ...`.

Read more about snippets [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_creating-your-own-snippets).

Snippets created with VSCode get extension `.code-snippets`. Extension "Easy Snippet" save the file with extension `.json` and use its filename as language they apply for.

```javascript
// Global snippets are saved here
C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets
```

<p align="right"><a id="terminal-in-vscode" href="#table-of-content">‚Ü© Back To Top</a></p>

### **[Terminal](#)**

VSCode comes with an integrated terminal window. By default it starts with working directory that is **the root** of your opened workspace. 

> Note, you can open **an external terminal window** with command `Ctrl + Shift + C`.  

You can open several terminals at once and to right is a tabbed list of them. Remove terminal instances by pressing the Trash Can button. You can split the terminal to see 2 at once. You can also navigate to diffrent working directories by drag and dropping folders onto command `cd`.

 It is also possible to switch between _shells_ that power the terminal. It is done from a drop down in the right upper corner of the terminal window (select profile). It can also be done by opening `Command Palette -> Terminal:Select Default Shell`. There you will get a list of available choices for you operating system where `Git Bash` (the default shell that we use) is one of the options.
 
 [Read more](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics#:~:text=To%20open%20the%20terminal%3A,the%20View%3A%20Toggle%20Terminal%20command.) about the terminal.

### **[Intelisense]()**

Intellisense provides suggestions as you type for javascript, typescript, json, html, css, scss and less out of the box. Pressing Tab or Enter will insert the selected member. 

Launch intelisense with `Ctrl + space`

<p align="right"><a id="settings-and-formatting" href="#table-of-content">‚Ü© Back To Top</a></p>

### **[Settings and Code Formatting]()**

For more heavy projects or personal preferences often some customization is needed. Customizing and getting all extensions, setting, formatters, linters to work together can be a time consuming task. 

### **Settings**  
VSCode settings visually in a GUI can be viewed and changed from `File > Preferences > Settings`. 

Settings are saved in 3 types of setting files and you can open those files by searching in command palette for them:

**User Settings (JSON)**
Personal settings added for each change to user specific file `..user/settings.json`. This file is possible to edit and its contend overwrites _defaultSettings.json_.

**Default Settings (JSON)** 
Global default settings as shipped with VSCode in a read only file named _defaultSettings.json_. Each installed extensions default settings are automatically added here to. This file is really good to look into and chech what the defalt setting was after making some changes.

**Workspace Settings (JSON)** 
Settings saved in `root/.vscode/settings.json` that are valid only in given workspace. This file is possible to edit and its contend overwrites _user/settings.json_ and _defaultSettings.json_.

The same apply to **Keyboard Shortcuts**. File **keybindings.json** can edited and modified though UI. The default shortcut definitions can be found in file `Default Keyboard Shortcuts(JSON)` from command palette (ctrl+shift+p).

### **Formatting**  
For HTML and JavaScript there are default formatters shipped with VSCode but at writing moment CSS do not have any formatter. An extension must be installed to format CSS.Same applies for Vue. There are popular extensions like **Prettier** (supporting formatting of pretty much all languages, including CSS) and **Volar** for Vue. Those extensions overwrite native VScode formatting by adding formatting with syntax highlighting and styles on their own. Note that prettier have their own opinionated configuration that can not be changed but there are some settings like line length, semicollon in ens of line or usage of double/single quotes.

By default shortcuts like `Ctrl+K Ctrl+F` formats only the selection and `Ctrl+Alt+F` whole document, but **by enabling** `Editor: Format on save` in VSCode settings the formater will be run for each save. Recommended to set it.

**Wrap HTML attributes?**  
In _Settings_ search for `HTML> Format: Wrap Attributes` and `HTML> Format: Wrap Line Length`. `Auto` is default and can be changed if you prefer different styles of how HTML attributes shall be wrapped. Our favorite is "preserve-aligned" that reserves user wraps but if line too long aligns everything.


<p align="right"><a id="diffrent-application-types" href="#table-of-content">‚Ü© Back To Top</a></p>

## **[Web applications](#)**
---

### [**Different application types**](#)

**Web Applications** are web sites (accessible via a URL) built for the browser using web technologies such as HTML, JS, CSS and backend. 

**Progressive Web Apps** expands web applications to be ‚Äúinstalled‚Äù onto a device directly from the browser. This includes mobile, tablets, and even your computer‚Äôs desktop. It then runs in a headless browser so it looks 100% like an app and even works in offline mode.   

**Native Apps** are apps that are built and compiled for a specific operating system, whether it is Android or iOS.   

**Hybrid Apps** are web apps that have been written using web technologies such as HTML, JS, and CSS and have been compiled into a native shell and can installed and downloaded natively like a native apps.   

<p align="right"><a id="typical-project-structure" href="#table-of-content">‚Ü© Back To Top</a></p>

### [**Typical project structure**](#)
Structure of the projects vary depending on type of project. For example Nuxt have its own opinionated folder structure with predefined folder names. See Nuxt specific document.

Scruffolding a Vue project usually generates predefined structure of folders.

It is also  very common that tools for building and auto-generating source code are used. Tools like for building whole projects like Webpack, Vite or tools for building CSS only like TODO or tools for building javascript only like TODO.  

But there are some general structure that might look like following

```
/root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ / dist
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ / public 
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.ico
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html (main entry point, links to styles.css & main.js)
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.js  (usually autogenerated from /src/assets/styles/styles.css)
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js    (usually autogenerated from /src/main.js) 
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /src

‚îÇ   ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _colors.css
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _variables.css
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ / modules
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _base-button.css
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css    (all application style, usually auto-generated)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ / scripts 
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ / components
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ           ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  header.js
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ           ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js       (all scripts here, usually auto-generated)     
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ / node_nodules     (auto-generated by "npm install")
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ / router
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ / store 
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ / mixins
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ / components 
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ / pages            (entry points/views for routes)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js / main.js   (often entry point for apps build builders)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  package.json / package-lock.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  webpack.config.js / vite.config.js / vue.config.js / nuxt.config.ts    (project dependent configuration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  eslintrc.js     (configuration for ES Lint, can be defined in package.json)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  babel.config.js    (configuration for Balel that is used by webpack, can be defined in package.json)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**dist** - Usually files that can be deployed to server are autogenerated and placed in this folder. Then a builder like Vite or Webpack do its magic and produces files that can be deployed. Note! Folders and files from `public` are normall just copied as they are. In case no project builder used then public is same as dist.

**public** - Files and folder placed here shall simply be copied in production build to dist folders as they are. Not go through webpack or any other builder. You must reference them in your code using absolute paths.

**src** - here we place are the source files that we modify manually to build up our project

**src/assets** ‚Äî Folder where you put any assets like images, styles or scripts  that you link to in your. Fileshere are most often transfformed by building tools. Often files here are imported into the project.

## [**Node**](#) 
### **[Node.js & Nodemon & Npm & Npx](#)**

NodeJS is¬†lightweight runtime environment for JavaScript. When installing node you also get **npm** client that you can use to download and manage packages. By default NodeJs do not understand typescript, only javascript.

**Execute .js file with node:**
```javascript
> node javascript.js
```

### Nodemon
The node command has to be re-executed each time we want to run a js file. To restart the file execution automatically use the [**nodemon**](https://nodemon.io/). You can install it globally with `npm i -g nodemon` but can also install nodemon as a development dependency:
 
**Execute .js file with nodemon**
```javascript
> nodemon javascript.js

// Now each change triggeer an execution. To abort listening to channges press Ctrl-C.
```

### Npm 
Npm is a package manager included in Node and makes is possible to download and store packages. Npm packages perform various tasks i.e. automate things or run server programs.  For example [**lodash**](https://lodash.com/) or [**normalize**](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/) are packages used in web projects that contain functions that are used by code in our project. Those type of packages are so called **development dependant**. Packages that are not development dependant are those that just run and perform some task but do not contain functions accessed by our written code. Example are webpack, vite or various frameworks.

### Npx 
Npx comes with the npm. It is an npm package runner that can execute any package from the npm registry **without** installing the package locally. You can use npx in same way as npm commands but it might be a bit slower as it runs from the cloud.

**Package.json** 
This is the main file for our project where a list (name and version) of all downloaded nmp packages that our project use. The packages themself are stored in auto-created folder `node_modules` in project root. This folder is normally excluded in git becouse it can easially be recreated with all its content by running command `npm install`. In this file are also defined some script that can be run.
  
**Usefull npm commands**
```java
> npm init -y // creates new package.json file in new (empty) project

// list installed versions as defined in package.json 
> npm list 
> npm list -all // list all depth dependencies
> npm list -all --depth=1 // list packages installed by wrappers i.e nuxt includes vue
> npm list vue  // list all packages with vue in its name

// list installed global node js packages
> npm list -g

// install a package with dependencies, same as with --save
> npm install [package_name]
> npm i [package_name] 

// install a package with dev-dependencies
> npm install [package_name] --save-dev
> npm i [package_name] -D

// Installs latest official only for not yet installed modules as defined in package.json
// Does NOT update already installed modules to latest. Creates node_modules if needed.
// If a module removed from package.json then this will remove it from npde_modules to.
> npm install
> npm i

// Installs latest official for not yet installed modules as defined in package.json
// UPDATES already installed modules to latests. Creates node_modules if needed.
// If a module removed from package.json then this will remove it from npde_modules to.
> npm update  
> npm update -g

// this option to be added to save exact the version we download (x.y.z)
// Otherwise ^x.y.z will be saves and later
--save-exact

// list current, wanted and latest official version of 
> npm outdated  
> npm outdated -g

// uninstall a (global) package 
> npm uninstall [package-name]  
> npm uninstall -g [package-name])

// check status of all dependencies in the project
> npm audit

## [**Node vs Browser vs Modules**](#)

Javascript can be run in Browser or in NodeJs enviroment. Code written for each of those differ and the code execution in NodeJs might generate errors in browser, and vice versa.

In order to run **import** statements (ES Modules) in NodeJs then file must be saved .mjs or row "type":"module" must be added in package.json when executing the file with node command.

To make http get request the browser have build Web API called **fetch**. But fetch do only work in browser, not in NodeJs. Npm package Axios is a similar package that work in same way both in browser as in NodeJs.

[Read more @mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
[Good explanation @youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK54Cn4ceac)

```javascript
// When in browser following line in <head> loads Axios from cdn
// <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>

if (typeof axios === 'undefined') {
   // Only on NodeJs
   axios = require('axios');
}
const apiUrl = 'https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random';

// This runs both in browser and NodeJs
(async function () {
   try {
      const response = await axios.get(apiUrl);
      const data = response.data;
      console.log('Fetched with Axios: ', data.message);
   } catch (err) {
      console.log(`Axios http get failed. ${err.message}`);
   }
})();

// This runs only in browser (no axios needed)
(async function () {
   try {
      const response = await fetch(apiUrl);
      const data = await response.json();
      console.log('Fetched with Fetch:', data.message);
   } catch (err) {
      console.log(`Fetch http get failed. ${err.message}`);
   }
})();
```

``` js
// Run only in node
const fs = require('fs');

// Run only in node but...
// Files with an .mjs extension
// Files with a .js extension when the nearest (parent) package.json file
// contains a top-level value: "type": "module".
import fs from 'fs'
```

### [**Npm packages & versioning**](#)

By default npm installs packages using `^`. You can switch this behavior by using `--save-exact`.

# **major.minor.patch**

Caret (**^**) ‚Äî gives you the highest minor version & highest patch version.
Lamda (**~**) ‚Äî gives you only the highest highest patch version.

```java
"vuetify": "^4.5.0", // Update 2 last digits
"vuetify": "~4.5.0", // Update 1 last digit
"vuetify": "4.5.0",  // npm install with option --save-exact. Will not update.
```
If you‚Äôve got a lockfile, before npm installs your dependencies, it checks the versions on the lockfile and installs them. So, in the case above, if the new developer has the same lockfile as the first developer, then he‚Äôd have the same version. Which leads me to my next point ‚Äî the lockfile should be pushed to git if you want to conserve consistency between all the teammates working on the same project.

In order to update your dependencies to their max version (according to the range specified), you‚Äôll need to run a command called **npm update**. ‚Äù. This will also update the lockfile with the new installed version.

## [**Webpack**](#)

### [**What is Webpack**](#)

Webpack is a bundler, code transpiler, dependencies manager and general automation tool that is used widely in web development. Webpack builds and transpiles javascript for node and generates new minimal html/css/js files files that are optimized to run in a browser. It can perform lots of automation stuff like converting pictures, combining and transforming files and executing scripts.  Webpack is instructed in _webpack.config.js_, in root of the running project, file where to start bundling (entry .js file). By default webpack only understands javascript, but with help of loader packages we can ninstruct webpack how to handle other languaages. Before Webpack gained popularity [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) or [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) were popular bundlers (task runners).

Good YouTube tutorial 'Webpack Crash Course' can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lziuNMk_8eQ)  

<p align="right"><a id="webpack-dev-server-m" href="#table-of-content">‚Ü© Back To Top</a></p>

### [**Webpack Dev Server**](#)

Webpack Dev Server is a npm package (named _webpack-dev-server_) that powers up a local server and serves compiled files from your project to it. It can automatically when a file withing a project is saved inject code to running browsers, hot module replacement. This injection is done is such a way that browser do not need to perform any 'hard refresh' and keeps its state which is very convenient when CSS styling as we keep the state of the UI. Content can also be reached from several browsers on the same wi-fy network at the same time. In order to get it work some lines need to be adde in _package.json_ and _webpack.config.js_ and some npm packages need to be installed.

To add Webpack-dev-server to project:

```javascript
> npm install -D webpack-dev-server
// or
> npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev

```

In projects **package.json** add new script to run it:

```javascript
"serve": "webpack serve",
"build": "webpack"
```

Example of configuration for web **webpack.config.js**:

```javascript
...
DevServer: {
    before: (app, server) => { server._watch('./__/*.html') },
    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'app'),
    hot: true,
    stats: 'errors-only',
    noInfo: false,
    port: 3000,
    host: '0.0.0.0'
},
...
```

### [**Vue CLI**](#)
Vue Cli runs webpack inside and hides webpack.config.js file but it can be configure from vue.config.js file [read more here](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).  

Vue CLI uses PostCSS internally. Read more [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/css.html#automatic-imports).

Example how to add postCSS plugins to Vue cli project through **vue.config.js**:
```javascript
const { defineConfig } = require('@vue/cli-service');

module.exports = defineConfig({
   css: {
      loaderOptions: {
         postcss: {
            postcssOptions: {
               // options here will be passed to postcss-loader
               plugins: [
                  require('postcss-import'), // set first
                  require('postcss-nested'),
                  require('postcss-simple-vars')
               ]
            }
         }
      }
   }
});
```

### [**PostCSS in webpack**](#)

**PostCSS** functionality can be added to your weback project. Note that postcss and postcss-cli are by default included by webpack!

Read more [here](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#webpack)

```javascript
// webpack specific plugins for postcss to work
> npm i -D postcss-loader style-loader css-loader
// postcss plugins
> npm i -D postcss-import postcss-mixins postcss-simple-vars postcss-nested

// Additionaly we need to add some configuration in Webpack.config.js to utilize the plugins
```

<p align="right"><a id="build-for-production" href="#table-of-content">‚Ü© Back To Top</a></p>

### [**Build for production**](#)

A project development consists of two phases. One is coding and testing internally on local machine  and after all is done and tested to set up all files so that we can deploy them to a server to serve and run publicly.

The process of coding uses special syntax and tools that aim to help the developer to code as fast as possible. The code created in this state is normally not usable in normal browsers,as a browser would not understand the special syntax and file structure used. Here special tools like Webpack Dev Server or VSCode extension Live Server helps us to visualy test and see the progress under development.

In order to **deploy** we must build our code in the project to structure and format that is suitable for publishing to a server. Normally this code is generated and saved in a special directory in root of the project called "**dist**".

For webpack a buld process can persist of followin steps:

-   Run an npm script instructing webpack to start a buld for production. Webpack.config.js instructs to run special commands and use special plugins for this. Example [here](#webbpack-config-js)
-   Webpack creates "dist" for generated files, but first empties it in case soemething is already generaates inside it.
-   If the bundled file is becomming to big - chank it up in smaller files that can be loaded when needed (lazy loading)
-   Autogenerate one file transpiles css file contaning our css/postcss/scss code.
-   Minimize all files.
-   Copy all assets (like images) to "dist"
-   Autogenerate all dependencies and .html file and save in "dist"
-   Change reference to script/css files in `<script>` `<link>` elements in html file to refer to correct newly autogenerated .css and .js files.

There can be more steps needed depending on type of project and needs. All the steps are performed with help of npm plugins and customized a [webpack.config,js](#webbpack-config-js) file.

<p align="right"><a id="webbpack-config-js" href="#table-of-content">‚Ü© Back To Top</a></p>

### [**Webpack.config.js file**](#)

_Exmaple of an `webpack.config.js` file_
```javascript
// recognizing what script is run - 'serve'/'dev'/'build'
const npmScript = process.env.npm_lifecycle_event; 

// PostCSS plugins that transform our written css to "browser-friendly"
const postCSSPlugins = [
   require('postcss-import'),
   require('postcss-mixins'),
   require('postcss-simple-vars'),
   require('postcss-nested')
];

module.exports = config = {
   entry: path.resolve(__dirname, 'entry.js'), // path to .js file to start bundling
   module: { rules: [] }, // populated later depending on compilation mode.
};

if (npmScript == 'dev') {
     config.mode = 'development';
     config.output = { 
                        path: '', 
                        filename: 'bundled.js'  // bundled javascript will be served from cache (not save to any location)
                     }; 
    config.module.rules = [
      {
         test: /\.css$/i,
         use: [
            'style-loader', // bundel css & as javascript in one file to browser
            {
               loader: 'css-loader', // bundle css into a js-file with import
               options: { url: false } // by default=true, css-loader handles images (e.g.background images). It can be disabled.
            },
            {
               loader: 'postcss-loader', // loads various postcss plugins to transform postcss to pure css
               options: {
                  postcssOptions: { plugins: postCSSPlugins }
               }
            },
            {
                test: /\.vue$/,
                loader: 'vue-loader' // parses parts of vue components
            }
         ]
      }
   ];
    
} else if (npmScript == 'build') {

TODO write about vite

<p align="right"><a id="documenting-code" href="#table-of-content">‚Ü© Back To Top</a></p>

## [**Documenting your code (JSDoc)**](#)

[JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) is a "markup language" for documentation aswell it is improving intellisense as it is build in VSCode. To instruct intellisense in VScode we can use JSDoc‚Äôs `@param`, `@type` and `@typedef` block tags in comments `/** */`.

Read more about jsdoc [here](https://jsdoc.app/tags-param.html#examples)

First we must enable type checkong:
```javascript
Add this to beginning of each js/ts file 
//@ts-check

To check skip one file
// @ts-nocheck

To disable one error
// @ts-ignore

or

/* Modify workspace setting */
/* Note! Is any js/tsconfig.jscon exists for the project */
/* then this have no affect and we must set in in config */
"js/ts.implicitProjectConfig.checkJs": true

or

/* Add to "jsconfig.json" */
"compilerOptions": {
   "checkJs": true
}
/* Add to "tsconfig.json"  */
"compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true,
    "checkJs": true
  }

```
Example
```javascript
/** @type {number | string | null} */
let foo;
foo = "hello" // 
foo = undefined //
foo = {}

// Here intellisense will then show correct type of foo as <Array>

/** Function description ...
 *  @param {string} fName - parameter description with type
 */
function fnc(fName) {... return true/false}

// Here intellisense will then show correct type of fName as <string>, decription texts. 

/** Assign the project to an employee. Destructing example.
 *  @param {Object} employee - The employee ocject
 *  @param {string} employee.name - Name of the employee
 *  @param {string} employee.department - Employee's department
 */
const fnc = function(employee) {... }
const fnc = function({ name, department }) {...}


/** Says hello. Several inputs.
 * @param {(string|string[])} somebody - Name, or an array of names
 */
function sayHello(somebody) {...}
   
```

### [**Postcss**](#)
A tool for transforming custom css using javascript plugins. It is neither a post-processor nor a pre-processor, on its own simply an api that transforms special CSS syntax into vanilla CSS. It is used in many popular front-end tools, task runners and bundlers like _Nuxt_, _Next_, _Weback_, _Vite_. You can use only the plugins for features you need just for your application (opposite to including whole sass/less).

> Install  **PostCSS Intellisense and Highlighting** plugin if you are using **Visual Studio Code** editor, so that your editor can recognize any new postcss syntax and stop giving you errors.

#### Plugins:
-  [postcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss) - a tool for transforming css styles
-  [postcss-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss) - command line interface to run from npm scripts.
-  [postcss-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-loader) - for webpack only! Loader for various postCSS plugins.
-  [postcss-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-import) - lets us import CSS files into other files unsing @import (different than the _bad_ import in native CSS). Note, this shall be executed first (defined on top).
-  [postcss-mixins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-mixins) -  define styles that can be re-used and media queries mixins sass-style. Note! Set this plugin before postcss-simple-vars and postcss-nested. 
-  [postcss-simple-vars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-simple-vars) - for Sass-like variables i.e $color: red
-  [postcss-nested](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-nested) -  for nesting in CSS 
-  [postcss-media-minmax](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-media-minmax) -  media queries using more intuitive properties 
-  [autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer) - Adds browser dependent CSS prefixes when needed (by default build in webpack, nuxt). Autoprefixer uses _browserslist_ i.e.  "browserslist": [ "defaults" ] in package.json
-  [postcss-normalize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-normalize) -   use parts of normalize.css or sanitize.css as defined by _browserslist_.
__________
-  [postcss-preset-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-preset-env) -  convert modern CSS (features from CSSDB) into something most browsers can understand. Mixins, media, custom...  
-  [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) -  takes your css and runs it through optimisations, to ensure that the final result is as small as possible for a production.

```java
// First install the tool itself (postcss-cli is needed for npm scripts)
> npm i -D postcss postcss-cli

// install some plugins
> npm i -D postcss-import postcss-mixins postcss-simple-vars postcss-nested postcss-media-minmax autoprefixer postcss-normalize cssnano 

// npm script to execute, in package.json (add -w to watch for changes, add -u for used plugins)

<p align="right"><a id="vue-and-bootstrap" href="#table-of-content">‚Ü© Back To Top</a></p>

### [**Bootstrap**](#)

Bootstrap 5 framework is an option to build responsive websites with a mobile-first approach. [Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-bootstrap-4-and-bootstrap-5/) are some diffrences between Boootstrap 4 and 5.

There are several ways to include bootstrap to your project. While Bootstrap doesn‚Äôt include extensive icons by default, they do have own small icon library that they provide. They have some classes drawing icons that they provide with their default components like `btn-clos`e or `navbar-toggler-icon`. But to install full package of scg bootstrap icons follow [this](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).

-   **Bootstrap through CDN (add and load from html header)**

This option in worst case downloads all css and all javascript even though we might only use parts of it. It is fast and handy to set up and get started but... it is not optimal and will for sure not make our page load as fast as possible.

```html
<head>
    <!--  CSS (required) -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" />

     <!-- Icons (optional) -->
    <link  rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.1/css/all.min.css" />

    <!--  JavaScript (required) -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script>
</head>
```

-   **Bootstrap as Npm package**

```html
___________________ add to packages.json _______________
<!-- bootstrap & dependency to get some componentsi.e dropdown to work -->
> npm i bootstrap @popperjs/core

<!-- Popular free nice icons (optional as bootstrap do not use them in their examples. 
Those they use they provide as vectors in css) -->
> npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-free

<!-- in order to be able to change theme/colors those loaders will be needed -->
> npm i -D sass-loader sass
```

In your main styles.css you must import:

```javascript
______________________ main.js ___________________________
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';  // original css
import 'bootstrap'; // all javascript files


// note! you can import individual components also if you want. See documentation.
```

Now after import all the classes are **avaiable globally** in each coponent! Good to go!

In order to **change theme or color** definitions you need change the provided source scss files and rebuild then. Add following someehre to flow in yourmain styles.css file.

```javascript
// own theme/variable/color customization
$primary: blue;
$secondary: gray;

// import unbuild bootstrap styles as source code (dafult values will be owerwritten by our changed)
import '../../../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss';

// Then webpack when building with help of our installed sass-loder and sass plugins
// will exchange our customized things in .scss files and generatre new css that will 
// be globally applied in our code, with our modifications.
```

### [**Mdb**](#)

Mbd encapsulates bootstrap and adds on some extra functionality and effects with Material Design tauch. It is enhenced bootstrap that they provide for free. Their documentation is better than bootstrap and a bit cooler featers.

-   **Install Mdb through CDN (add in html header)**

```html
_____________________ html head ________________________
     <!-- CSS -->
    <link  rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mdb-ui-kit/3.10.2/mdb.min.css" />

    <!-- Icons (must be included for example to work) -->
    <link  rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.1/css/all.min.css" />

    <!-- Javascript -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mdb-ui-kit/3.10.2/mdb.min.js" defer></script>

    <!-- note! defer forces to load the page content first before executing js-script -->
</head>
```

This option in worst case downloads for every page ALL css and ALL javascript even though we might use only parts of it. It is fast and handy to set up but... it is not optimal and will for sure not make our page load as fast as possible.

-  **Mdb as Npm package (in Vue CLI project)**

In your Vue entry script (usually main.js or app.js) you need to import the css and javascript and icons:

```javascript
______________________ main.js ___________________________


import 'mdb-ui-kit/css/mdb.min.css'; // original css
import 'mdb-ui-kit'; // all javascript files

import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';  // original css
import 'bootstrap'; // all javascript files

// note! you can import individual components also if you want. See documentation.
```

Now after import all the classes are avaiable globally in each coponent!

```html
___________________ add to packages.json _______________
<!-- mdb free files -->
> npm i mbd-ui-kit

<!-- popular free nice icons (used  in mdb examples) -->
> npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-free

<!-- in order to be able to change theme/colors those loaders will be needed -->
> npm i -D sass-loader sass
```

Now after import all the classes are **avaiable globally** in each coponent! Good to go!

In order to **change theme or color** definitions you need change the provided source scss files and rebuild then. Add following someehre to flow in your main.js file.

```java
// own theme/variable/color customization
$primary: blue;
$secondary: gray;
...

// import unbuild mdb styles as source code (dafult values will be owerwritten by our changes)
@import '../../../../node_modules/mdb-ui-kit/src/scss/mdb.free.scss';

Then webpack when building with help of our installed sass-loder and sass plugins will exchange our customized things in .scss files and spot out new css that will be globally applied in our code, with our modifications!
```

### [**Fonte Awsome (FA) Icons**](#)

There are three methods how to include font awesome icons into you project: 
1. **[Seperate SVG Icons](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/vue/)** - Recommended for production. This method allows you to slim down the build package
2. **[SVG + JS method](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/host-yourself/svg-js)**  - Nice clear icons, fast to get started, recommended for prototyping and testing out. Hard to choose seperate icons, big bundle size.
3. **[Web Fonts + CSS method](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/host-yourself/webfonts)** - Fastest to get started with, recommended for prototyping and testing out. Hard to choose seperate icons, big bundle size.

   
You can read about how they differ and what to choose - **[here](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/dig-deeper/webfont-vs-svg)**. 

Those are free icons provided by fontawesome - [here](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free&s=regular%2Csolid)

> Note! It's a handy to import **all** the icon styles for flexibility and to test out different styles as you develop (method 2 & 3). But if you're using just a couple of iconss and styles, we **don't recommend** it for production sites since loading all of the icons styles and fonts isn't great for performance. The bundle size increase and also css files sent from server may contain unnecessary unused styles.

> Note! There are three families of Font Awesome icons:  Classic, Sharp and Brands. Each of the filily contain diffrent styles: Solid, Regular, Light,This, Duotone, Brands. Some are free (Brands, Solid, Regular), some not. See [here](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/add-icons/how-to).

Most easy to get started is with npm package that includedes all you need all icons and functionality you need.
```bash
> npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-free
```

**Include with Web Fonts + CSS method**
In `node_modules/@fortawesome/fontawsome-free/` the `/css` folder contains css files for all icons and styles. The `/webfonts` folder contains all of the typeface files that our css styles depend on and link to.

You can eather **copy** `/webfonts` and `/css` into local folder like `/assets/fontawesome/` where you can modify its content by for example removing unwanted styles and icons. Or you can access files directly from node_modules.

```javascript
// Includes everything (big production bundle)
import "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.css"  

or
// Include just styles you want
import "@/assets/fontawesome/css/fontawesome.css"  // icons and utilities
import '@/assets/fontawesome/css/solid.css';  // fas prefix
import '@/assets/fontawesome/css/regular.css'; // work with fas prefix too.
import '@/assets/fontawesome/css/brands.css';  

or
// Link from html
 <link href="/assets/fontawesome/css/all.css" ref="stylesheets" >
 <link href="/assets/fontawesome/css/fontawesome.css" ref="stylesheets" >
 <link href="/assets/fontawesome/css/brands.css" ref="stylesheets" >
```

**Include with SVG + JS method** (fastest to get start with)
Pretty much same as above but instead of files from `/css` folder, use files from `/js` folder.

> Note! When importing whole file `import '../js/all.js'` in vite project bundle gets bigger than when importing all from css. Also worth noting that main.js file produced for production gets over 1400 kB easialy!

Youo can also link directly from html header like `<script defer src="/your-path-to-fontawesome/js/all.js"></script>`.

**Seperate SVG Icons** (recommended for production, Vorks in Vue and Nuxt and Vite)

```javascript
// Install SVG core engine
npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core

// Install free icons styles (solid, regular, brands)
npm i @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons

// Install special helper component for Vue 3
npm i @fortawesome/vue-fontawesome@latest-3
```

```javascript
Vue | Nuxt example
In the file main.je or plugins/fontawesome.ts
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';

// main css for this project
import './assets/main.css';

// icons
// import '@/assets/icons/fontawesome.js';

/* import the fontawesome core */
import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core';

/* import font awesome icon component */
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/vue-fontawesome';

/* import specific icons (here same from diffrent styles) */
import { faUser as fasUser } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';
import { faUser as farUser } from '@fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons';
import { faFacebook } from '@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons';

library.add(fasUser, farUser, faFacebook);

createApp(App).component('fa-icon', FontAwesomeIcon).mount('#app');
```

```javascript
Vuetify example
In the file plugins/fontawesome.ts

import { createVuetify } from 'vuetify';
import 'vuetify/styles';

// import vuetify components and directives
import * as components from 'vuetify/components';
import * as directives from 'vuetify/directives';

// import build-in vuetify iconsets (fontawesome-svg and mdi icons)
import { aliases, fa } from 'vuetify/iconsets/fa-svg';
import { mdi } from 'vuetify/iconsets/mdi';

/* import fontawesome svg core */
import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core';

/* import fontawesome vue 3 helper component */
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/vue-fontawesome';

/* import ALL icons - for prototyping only as this produces huge production bundle */
import { fas } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';
import { far } from '@fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons';
import { fab } from '@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons';
import '@mdi/font/css/materialdesignicons.css';

// Add all used icons here
const icons = [fas, far, fab];

// Add own customized aliases here
const allAliases = { ...aliases, myCustAlias: 'fas fa-circle' };

export default defineNuxtPlugin(nuxtApp => {


   // Creating vuetify with customization
   const vuetify = createVuetify({
      components,
      directives,
      icons: {
         defaultSet: 'fa',
         aliases: allAliases,
         sets: { fa, mdi },
      },
   });

   library.add(...icons); // Include needed icons
   nuxtApp.vueApp.component('font-awesome-icon', FontAwesomeIcon); // note! vuetify looks at hardcoded "font-awesome-icon". Use this name always.
   nuxtApp.vueApp.use(vuetify);
   
   console.log(`Registered plugin vuetify.client.ts. Aliases = `, allAliases);
});
```

**Add icons in your code like this**
_class="Font-Style-Or-Alias + Icon-Name"_

Read [here](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/vue/style) how you can add styling in vue.

```html
// As in the first methods
<i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i> 
<i class="fas fa-user"></i> 
<i class="fa-brands fa-facebook fa-2x"></i>
<i class="fab fa-facebook fa-2x fa-spin" style='color: blue'></i>
// or 
<span class="fa-solid fa-user"></span>
<span class="fas fa-user"></span>

// or as in the last method
<fa-icon icon="fab fa-facebook" />
<fa-icon icon="far fa-user" />
```

## [**Error handling**](#)

Winston TODO finish this and put in correct place

```
console.log(` Object nbr ${i} is `, object)
console.debug
console.warning.
console.error

```

We want to have more levels, customized print style/coloring, printing to console/file/db/stream and controll if shall be part of production build.

You can try winston but not sure if it is ok to use in Vue frontend.

In order to remove completly logs from code build by vue CLI 4 add extension:  
npm install babel-plugin-transform-remove-console --save-dev

Then in babel.config.js add:  
plugins: [['transform-remove-console', { exclude: ['error', 'warn'] }]]

This will remove all logs except console.error and console.warn

### **Errorhandling**

The Error Object

Just what we can extract from it in an event of an error? The Error object in all browsers support the following two properties:

name: The name of the error, or more specifically, the name of the constructor function the error belongs to.

message: A description of the error, with this description varying depending on the browser.

Six possible values can be returned by the name property, which as mentioned correspond to the names of the error's constructors. They are:

Error Name Description

EvalError An error in the eval() function has occurred.

RangeError Out of range number value has occurred.

ReferenceError An illegal reference has occurred.

SyntaxError A syntax error within code inside the eval() function has occurred. All other syntax errors are not caught by try/catch/finally, and will trigger the default browser error message associated with the error. To catch actual syntax errors, you may use the onerror event.

TypeError An error in the expected variable type has occurred.

URIError An error when encoding or decoding the URI has occurred

throw will terminate the further execution & expose message string on catch the error.

```javascript
try {
    throw "I'm Evil";
    console.log("You'll never reach to me", 123465);
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e); // I'm Evil
}

try {
    throw Error("I'm Evil");
    console.log("You'll never reach to me", 123465);
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e.name, e.message); // Error I'm Evil
}

console.log(typeof new Error('hello')); // object
console.log(typeof Error); // function

Error(x) === new Error(x);
```

## [**Geo locations**](#)

### **Autocomplete**

Here we describe how to get suggestions of city names from google API when typing in an `<input>` field. Suggestions will be show in a dropdown list and this drowdown list we populate and customize ourselfs. When one proposal in the dropdown list is chosen we get and save its: name, id, latittude and longitoude.

To start with:

1. An **object** (written by google) that handles retrieving of predictions must be downloaded and identified with you personal api_key, so that google can connect billing of your account. (How to enable and create such an api_key is described [here](todo).) Such a request in its simplest way can be done by addig a `<script>` tag in the header of your page, so when the page is loaded the needed object loads automatically.

```javascript
// header
<script src='https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=<YOUR_API_KEY>&libraries=places'></script>
```

Now in javascript code we can access the `object` with:

```javascript
let gService = window.google.maps.places.AutocompleteService();
```

2. As we can acces functions that our gService object provides we will use `getPlacePredictions(options, callback)` that takes some options as input and returns the suggestions in callback function that we provide as second parameter.

options described [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/places-autocomplete-service#AutocompletionRequest)

```javascript
// tell google service how and what to suggest for
let options = {
    input: str, // mandatory, string that we suggest for i.e. "L", "Lo", "Lon", "Lond", "Londo", "London"
    types: ['(cities)'], // mandatory, restrict results to be cities only. not set returnes all types
    componentRestrictions: { country: ['au', 'us', 'br'] }, // optional, if desires restric to some countries
    location: { lat: -34, lng: 151 }, // optional, if first suggestions shall be close to special location
    radius: 2000, // with location, meters from location obove for prefered suggestions.
    sessionToken: XXX // nique reference used to bundle individual requests into sessions.
};

// tell google service where provide the suggestions
let callback = function (suggestions, status) {
    if ((status = 'OK')) {
        this.suggestionsToShow = suggestions;
    }
};
```

### [**Markdown**](#)

Markdown is a lightweight markup language (HTTP is a markup language too) to style text on the web in a fast way. The syntax is much simpler than HTML as it originally was created for non-programmers in order to write easy-to-read format that could be converted directly into HTML. Markdown files are saved with extension .md and only special readers can view them. GitHub for example use its own readme-file-viewer for all README.md files in the root of a project. Chrome with a special plug-in extension can view this files in nice way. Using markdown for styling text makes it possible to view text in a nicer way than just simple text. VSCode have Markdown preview build-in.

> Note! Each heading starting with `#` in background creates a class id based on name. In case of heading `## Node.js & Npm-files` the created id will be `#nodejs--npm-files`. In order to internally navigate to this heading use: `[PRESS HERE](#nodejs--npm-files)` and an internal link will be created.

**Recommended VSCode Extensions**

[Markdown Shortcuts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)<br> Adds a list of toggle commands/shortcuts shown in drop-down list when right-clicking in .md file. Very convenient to toggle a selection by choosing from a list. In settings \__ or _ can be chosen to use instead of \*_ and _. Also on title bas GUI icons are shown for .md files, can be customized in options.

[Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)<br> Exports to HTML. Export HTML to PDF with browser (e.g. Chrome) if you want.<br> Creates Table Of Content. Use <!-- omit in toc --> beside/above heading to ignore it.<br> Paste (CTRL-V) a link on selected text to create a markdown link.<br> Autocompletion of available assets with ./<br>

This setion is about screen sizes,  images, backgrounds and icons.

#### [Screen Resolution]()

Resolution refers to number of pixels that make up the image on a screen. A higher pixel count means that sharper picture and possibility to show big sharp images with good quality. Resolution is expressed using horizontal and vertical pixel counts.<br>

<p align=right><a id="visual-studio-code" align=right href="#table-of-content">‚Ü© Back To Top</a></p>

The predominant display aspect ratio on 2020s PC market, including laptops,tablets, and monitors, is 16:9. Also referred to as widescreen aspect ratio. I.e FULL HD 1920x1080 have 16:9 aspect ratio.



# [**SEO**](#)

<p align="right"><a id="visual-studio-code" href="#table-of-content">‚Ü© Back To Top</a></p>

When a ord that someone search for is in H1 and then later in desrtiptio h2 and then many times in text in same article then google might show prio it in SEO. H1 text is then shown in google search description

One of the most important features of HTML5 is its semantics. Semantic HTML refers to syntax that makes the HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web pages. It makes web pages more informative and adaptable, allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret content. For example, instead of using div id="header" you can use a header tag.

Example. article h1 - what is babajaga? h2 - Many peapople wonder what babajaga is - here comes the answer.abs P - babajag is ... Often babajaga do... We se many babajagas in..

## [**Python**](#)

Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language, comparable to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java.

Some of Python's notable features:

-   Uses an elegant syntax, making the programs you write easier to read.
-   Is an easy-to-use language ideal for prototype development without compromising maintainability.
-   Comes with a handy package manager `Pip` for installing python plugins (might be needed to install seperately for Ubuntu/Linux).
-   Comes with a collection of built-in functions and built-in packages.

Install Python globally on you local machine -> [www.python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

> Note! When installing on Windows make sure to add to PATH (a checkbox to check in installation wizard), then it will be avaiable globally from command prompt.

```java
> python --version  // Check current installed version
> phyton  // runs phytom program command line
```

### [**Virtual Enviroments**](#)

[Virtual environments](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#what-is-a-virtual-environment) are "folders" (in simple words) that are isolated and belong to you project and will contain all that packages that a python project use. This means that each project can have its own dependencies regardless of what dependencies every other project has. Then installed project packages and dependencies that you use inside this environment will be independent of your system interpreter.

One of build-in modules in Python 3 is [**venv**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) library that provides support for creating **lightweight** ‚Äúvirtual environments‚Äù. [Virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) is an external python plugin (widly used) that extends python's support for virtual environments as the default [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) library does not offer all posible features Virtualenv has.

From Python 3.4 you can use venv!

**Use `Venv`**

```java
// similar to virtualenv

> py -m venv x-venv  // creates a virtual environment named 'x-venv'

> x-venv/Scripts/activate.bat  // (windows) activate the 'x-venv' enviroment
> source x-venv/bin/activate  // (linux) activate the 'x-venv' enviroment
```

<br>

_Use `Virtualenv`_

```java
// FIRST OF ALL
// Navigate to root of your project!

// INSTALL PLUGIN
// installs extended virtual enviroment support
> pip install virtualenv

// Note!
// If 'virtualenv' is not a recognized command after installation then becouse its location is not in your system PATH. Easiest is to add its location to your system PATH. Otherwise you can add just run the module by adding "py -m ..." each time you run the command.

// CREATE PROJECT ENVIROMENT
// create a virtual environment named 'x-venv'
> virtualenv x-venv
// or
> py -m virtualenv x-venv

// Note!
// Now in the root of your project you will have a folder named "x-venv" where all kind of customization files and script were autogenerated and additions to your project will be stored. There shall also be a folder named Scripts or script where activation to run script can be found!

// ACTIVATE YOU ENVIROMENT
// When in your project root activate "x-venv" enviroment
> x-venv/Scripts/activate.bat  // (windows)
> source x-venv/bin/activate  // (linux)
```

### [**Pip**](#)

`Pip` is a standard package manager and for most operating systems comes out of the box with Phyton installation. It allows you to install and manage external packages that aren‚Äôt part of the Python standard library. Pip packages are automatically downloaded from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/).

> _It is similar as npm (Node Package Manager) that comes with instalation of NodeJs. Npm packages are downloaded from [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/package)_

<br>

Pip has a variety of commands and option flags designed to manage python packages. Reade more about how Pip works [here](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/).

> Important! To limit packages to a specific project we must run pip "inside" a virtual environment.

Usefull Pip **commands**

```java
// CHECK VERSION
> where pip
> pip --version
> pip3 --version //used by python 3

// INSTALL LATEST PACKAGE(S)
> py -m pip install package-1  package-2

// DISPLAY INSTALLED PACKAGES
> py -m pip list

// SAVE CURRENT PACKAGE VERSIONS
py -m pip freeze > requirements.txt

// INSTALL PACKAGES FROM LIST
> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
